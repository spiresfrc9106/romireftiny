# Example that shows how to connect to a ROMI from RobotPy
#
# Requirements
# ------------
#
#    # Install https://github.com/wpilibsuite/WPILibPi/releases/download/v2023.2.1/WPILibPi_64_image-v2023.2.1-Romi.zip
#    # on your Raspberry Pi sd card.
#
#    # On Windows, some people prefer to run python 3
#    py -3
#
#    # but sometimes when using Python virtual environments (venv) "py -3" does not run the python associated with
#    # the virtual environment, some people (this author) avoids "py -3", preferring "python"
#
#    # confirm that your python is 3.12 or greater
#    python -VV
#
#    python -m pip install robotpy
#    python -m pip install robotpy-halsim-ws
#
#
# Run the program
# ---------------
#
# To run the program you will need to explicitly use the ws-client option:
#
#    cd to this directory
#    python -m robotpy sync
#
#    power-up the Romi
#    connect to a WiFi network where the romi is on.
#
#    python -m robotpy sim --ws-client
#
# By default the WPILib simulation GUI will be displayed. To disable the display
# you can add the --nogui option
#
